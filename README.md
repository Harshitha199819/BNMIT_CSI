# BNMIT_CSI
Here are some of the resources from the workshop I conducted at BNMIT.
Topics covered in the workshop-
What is cloud?
AWS- services and concepts
Firebase- hosting applications and NoSQL

The scripts used for hosting a simple application using NoSQL and Firebase are here.
Since the AWS services were mostly discussed on the AWS console, I have not included them here
